## Usage

The Pianoroll project retrieves random data from pianoroll.ai using the `useFetchRolls` function. It then displays 20 results on the main page in the form of a dynamic grid. During the data retrieval process, a placeholder view known as "skeleton rolls" is displayed.

### Main Page
- The main page displays 20 random rolls in a dynamic grid.
- Users can select one of the displayed rolls.

### Roll View
- When a roll is selected, the view switches to a player view with the chosen roll.
- A list of the remaining 19 results is displayed alongside or below the player.

### User Interaction
- Users can switch between different rolls in the player view.
- Users can return to the main page displaying all rolls.
- On mobile devices, switching between rolls in the player view scrolls the screen to the top.

### Player
- The player consists of the `Player` component and the `MainPianoRoll`.
- It displays the start and end times of the selected roll.
- An "Indicator" is added to track the current playback position.
- Playback control buttons, including play/pause and stop, are provided.
- Clicking the stop button resets the Indicator to the beginning of the roll or the selected range.

### Selection
- Users can dynamically select a portion of the roll using the Indicator.
- The selected range can be played again using control buttons (PlayerOptions).
- Clicking outside the selection clears it, while clicking inside it doesn't remove the selection but moves the Indicator to the selected position.
- The selection can also be removed using a button in the selection menu next to the start-end time information.

### Interaction with the Rolls
- Clicking on a roll sets the Indicator to the chosen position.
- Clicking and dragging (or using touch on mobile devices) sets a range.

### Display
- Above the playback control buttons, the current player time is displayed.
- The "Selected Range" dynamically shows the selected time range and the number of included tiles.
- Selected tiles are also logged using `console.log` after the selection process.

### Refresh and Navigation
- The sound list can be regenerated by refreshing the page or clicking on the logo in the Navbar, which leads to the main page (/pianoroll).
